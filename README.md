# Noughts and Crosses
## Because I flat out refuse to say 'Tic-Tac-Toe'

This is my attempt at the Noughts and Crosses challenge as part of makers academy's week 10 (tech test week). We've been tasked to come up with a solution which is object oriented and easily portable.

The rules of noughts and crosses are as follows:

There are two players in the game (X and O)
Players take turns until the game is over
A player can claim a field if it is not already taken
A turn ends when a player claims a field
A player wins if they claim all the fields in a row, column or diagonal
A game is over if a player wins
A game is over when all fields are taken

### The task

To build the business logic for the game and make it easy to implement a working game by combining the code with any user interface, whether it's web or command-line.
